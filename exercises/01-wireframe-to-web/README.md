# Exercise 01 · Wireframe to Web (30-minute sprint)

## Purpose
Convert a grayscale wireframe into working HTML/CSS. Students practice reading design intent, choosing semantic tags, and applying responsive layout techniques from Lessons 01 and 02.

## Setup
- Open `starter.html` and `styles.css` in your editor.
- Reference the `wireframe.svg` from Lesson 02 for the layout goals.
- Timer suggestion: 25 minutes build + 5 minutes reflection.

## Success criteria
- Semantic structure mirrors the wireframe (header, main sections, footer).
- Layout adapts gracefully at 320px, 768px, and 1024px widths.
- Typography and spacing tokens use CSS custom properties for consistency.

## Submission options
- Commit your work with a descriptive message (`feat: complete wireframe sprint`).
- Record a quick walkthrough video or Loom explaining your decisions.

## Remix ideas
- Swap the color palette and explain how it shifts the mood.
- Translate the copy into another language and adjust spacing accordingly.
- Add a “stretch goal” component (like a testimonial) and annotate it in comments.

The `solution/` folder offers one approach if you need a reference or want to run a critique session.
