# Projects

Longer builds meant for multi-week arcs or capstone energy. Each project starter includes:

- A narrative prompt to get students emotionally invested.
- Milestones to break the work into critique-ready chunks.
- Rubric-friendly success metrics plus optional community-facing deliverables.

Feel free to fork, remix, and merge back your best iterations.
