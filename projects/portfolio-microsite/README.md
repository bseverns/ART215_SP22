# Project · Portfolio Microsite Remix

## Intent
Students craft a one-page portfolio microsite for a creative they admire (artist, designer, organizer, musician). The goal is to apply lessons from semantic HTML, responsive layout, and DOM interactions while telling someone else’s story with respect and flair.

## Timeline (2–3 weeks)
1. **Week 1 — Discovery & IA:** Research the subject, outline content, sketch wireframes (mobile + desktop).
2. **Week 2 — Build & iterate:** Implement structure and layout, gather peer feedback, refine typography and imagery.
3. **Week 3 — Interaction polish:** Layer in subtle DOM interactions (modal, filter, accordion) and prep for public launch.

## Deliverables
- **Content strategy doc (`content-plan.md`):** Audience, tone, narrative arc, and accessibility considerations.
- **Live site (`index.html` + assets):** Fully responsive, accessible, and performant.
- **Retrospective (`retro.md`):** What worked, what broke, what you’d try differently next time.

## Success metrics
- Semantic structure passes an accessibility tree spot-check (use screen reader or DevTools).
- Layout adapts to at least three breakpoints, with intentional typographic scale shifts.
- At least one progressive enhancement interaction that still leaves the content usable without JS.
- Git history shows regular commits with descriptive messages.

## Stretch challenges
- Integrate a simple CMS-like workflow (e.g., JSON data file + templating via Eleventy/Vite).
- Add localization support for two languages and note copy considerations in `content-plan.md`.
- Implement automated testing (Lighthouse CI, axe-core) and include results in the retrospective.

## Critique prompts
- How does the visual language honor the subject’s work without mimicking it?
- Where do interaction patterns enhance storytelling vs. distract from it?
- How would the site scale into a multi-page experience?

## Starter files
- `content-plan.md` — fill in with research notes and planned sections.
- `index.html` — baseline structure to customize.
- `styles.css` — CSS tokens and layout scaffolding ready for tweaking.
- `script.js` — optional interactive hooks (accordion + modal placeholders).

Run critiques at the end of each week. Encourage students to celebrate the messy middle, not just the polished deliverable.
