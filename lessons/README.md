# Lessons

Each lesson is a fully-scripted walkthrough designed for a 30â€“45 minute session. You get:

- A punky, plain-language README with objectives, vocabulary, and pacing hints.
- Ready-to-run demo files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, and sometimes `script.js`).
- Stretch goals so advanced students can keep rolling while you coach folks who need more time.

Teach them in sequence or mix them up depending on the energy in the room.
