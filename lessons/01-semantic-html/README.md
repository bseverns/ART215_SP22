# Lesson 01 · Semantic HTML Foundations

## Why this matters
Semantic HTML is the skeleton of every accessible, adaptable web page. We’re ditching meaningless `<div>` soup and building pages that screen readers and future collaborators can actually understand.

## Learning objectives
- Identify common semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
- Build a simple multi-section page with meaningful hierarchy.
- Pair headings and copy so content structure makes sense at a glance.

## Session flow (45 min)
1. **Hook (5 min):** Compare a semantic page vs. a div-only page. Ask students which one they’d rather maintain in a year.
2. **Live build (20 min):** Walk through the included `index.html` to show structure and intent.
3. **Guided remix (15 min):** Students replace the placeholder text with content from their own interests or another class.
4. **Share-out (5 min):** Invite a few people to narrate their structure and why it helps future readers.

## Vocabulary spotlight
- **Semantic element:** Tags that tell both humans and browsers what type of content they wrap.
- **Document outline:** The heading hierarchy that keeps content legible.
- **Accessibility tree:** The assistive-tech-facing structure generated from semantic markup.

## Stretch moves
- Add a `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for an image that matters to the story.
- Build a nested `<article>` inside a `<section>` to simulate a news site or blog roll.
- Validate the markup via [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and fix any warnings.

## Safety nets
- Provide the `starter.html` file (a bare structure) if anyone gets stuck copying tags.
- Encourage pair-programming: one student drives, the other navigates using the README as a checklist.

## Files in this lesson
- `index.html` — finished demo ready to present or dissect.
- `starter.html` — empty structure for students who want to build from scratch.
- `styles.css` — minimal aesthetics so the focus stays on structure.
