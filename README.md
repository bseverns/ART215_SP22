# ART215 // Web Design Toolkit

Welcome to the reorganized ART215 playground — a lean, loud toolkit for teaching and learning the fundamentals of web design. This repo is now structured as a set of guided lessons, remix-friendly exercises, and project starters so you can run class straight from the command line (or let students self-direct like the legends they are).

## Quick start

1. **Clone or download** this repo. Hand it to your class or fork it for your own remix.
2. **Open the lesson you want** inside the `lessons/` folder. Each one ships with an explainer README plus runnable HTML/CSS/JS.
3. **Serve the files locally** however you like. A quick option: `python3 -m http.server 8080` from the lesson folder and visit <http://localhost:8080>.
4. **Tweak, break, rebuild.** Every example is meant to be edited live so students can see the immediate impact.

## Repo layout at a glance

| Directory | What you’ll find | Classroom use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lessons/` | Step-by-step guided walkthroughs with sample code. | Live demos, flipped classroom prep, or asynchronous refreshers. |
| `exercises/` | Bite-sized challenges with clear success criteria. | Studio work, assessments, or extra-credit chaos. |
| `projects/` | Longer-form build prompts and starter files. | Capstones, portfolios, or collaborative sprints. |
| `resources/` | Curated links and cheatsheets. | Shareable reference material to keep curiosity stoked. |

Every folder has its own README that spells out intent, objectives, and extension ideas so you can riff or assign without reinventing the wheel.

## Teaching flow suggestions

- **Lesson ➡ Exercise ➡ Project:** Start with a guided lesson, reinforce with a quick exercise, then let students expand in a project starter.
- **Swap order freely:** Modules are intentionally independent. Need to hammer layout before semantics? Go for it.
- **Encourage commits:** Have students snapshot experiments with Git so they can track their evolution and build a portfolio narrative.

## Built-in differentiation tips

- Most lessons include stretch ideas for advanced students and “safety net” notes for those who need more scaffolding.
- Exercises flag required vs. optional steps, so you can dial complexity up or down mid-flight.
- Project starters include critique prompts — great for peer reviews or self-reflection journals.

## Remixing the toolkit

- **Add your own lessons:** Copy an existing lesson folder, rename it with the next number, and rewrite the README with your objectives.
- **Localize content:** Swap imagery, typography, or prompts to reflect your students’ communities and interests.
- **Version the semester:** Tag releases per semester so you keep a record of what you shipped and what the students smashed.

Open an issue or drop a pull request with suggestions. This repo is deliberately open-ended — if you have an assignment that rocked your class, throw it in here so others can build on it.

Stay curious, stay kind, and build the web you want to see.
